Hello, I'm Ayesha Ahmad. Welcome to my corner! This is my site and here I write about my technological interests and learnings.

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Syracuse University. And I am interested in pursuing a career in Data Science, Machine Learning and/or Deep Learning. And, I've been learning these during my masters.
I have a foundation in object oriented programming with JAVA and C++, algorithms, databases like MySQL. I have worked with JAVA for 2 years before my Masters at Sapient, India. I interned at Capella Education Company as a frontend/backend developer for the summer, 2017.  

I want to use my learnings so far and use it as a foundation to build up a career in Data Science. Everything in today's world is data and there is always something valuable that we can learn from it.

When I'm not studying or working, I am spending time with my near and dear ones or reading or spending time outdoors. I love taking long walks(in the mall during winters). I love traveling, however, I haven't had much of it so far. I do hope to do it more regularly in the future. I believe that traveling builds character and that each time I visit a place I get to learn something new, even if I visit for a short duration.

- I enjoy skimming through self help articles
- I have watched the show Friends over and over and I continue to do so

- I hope to make it big one day
